    //* Generics - abstract types that allow substitution with concrete ones 
    //* 
    //* BIG NOTE:
    //* Generics have much in common with C++ templates:
    //*     - Code is generated at compile-time
    //*     - Generic types can be further specialized by 'Traits' and concrete type specialization
    //*
    //* However, with generics you can also declare method for a specific types
    //* The method will thus only show up if your instance has the correct type
